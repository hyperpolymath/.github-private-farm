== Language Tier Classification

=== Tier 0: Verification Platinum
* *Idris 2* — Proofs-as-types with Quantitative Type Theory (QTT)

=== Tier 1: Gold Standard (Preferred)
* Rust — Systems, CLI, WASM
* Zig — Low-level, replacing C/C++
* Ada/SPARK — Safety-critical, formal verification
* Haskell — Pure functional, parsers, compilers
* Elixir — Distributed, fault-tolerant
* ReScript — Frontend with JS interop

=== Tier 2: Silver (Acceptable)
* Guile Scheme — Configuration, Guix packages, STATE.scm
* Nickel — Type-safe configuration
* Racket — DSLs, language-oriented programming
* Nix — Package derivations

=== Restricted Languages
* Python — Only allowed in `salt/` directories for SaltStack
* TypeScript/JavaScript — Legacy only, convert to ReScript/Deno
* Go — Use Rust instead
* C/C++ — Use Zig or Rust instead
